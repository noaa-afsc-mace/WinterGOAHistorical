Description: This is a data package with all of the pre-selectivity winter GOA data in it. It
    contains all the pre-net-selectivity-corrected winter GOA data (Shumagins and Shelikof).
    For Shelikof, this is 1995-2007, and for Shumagins this is 2001-2008. Other sub-areas are 
    also included. This package has all of the numbers and biomass at length for all of the different
    regions in one data set, and all of the numbers and biomass at age for the shelikof surveys in another. 
    The length & age data are organized by interval, transect, and region. The complete data set is included 
    in this package, and can also be re-queried using the "Update..." rmd if MB2 is updated and 
    the data need to be fetched again.
